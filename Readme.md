# Larger Videos & Slides for ICLR 2020

TL;DR: Use your full screen width for the videos and slides.

The online setup for ICLR 2020 is amazing, especially given the short preparation time. However, I think the slides and video are too small, as they have to share 60% of an already small container. Use this custom CSS to enlargen them and put them next to each other. You can also open RocketChat e.g. in Chrome to have it in a separate window.

- Open Firefox and enjoy the larger view!
- Use e.g. Chrome if your temporarily don't want it.

## Deactivate
Just remove the CSS file. To use the chat or temporarily deactivate the changes, you can just use Chrome :)
